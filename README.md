# weirdhouse
Getting to LVL 256 as a MOXIE CLASS in KoL's Mansion of Dr. Weirdeaux with KoLmafia. 

**This is for the browser based game kingdomofloathing.com, if you are not playing it, you should.**

This script is for power-leveling to 256, the max level. It is completely unnecessary for any other reason than to say you did, or if you are building a bot.

The adventure zone is here:
https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/The_Mansion_of_Dr._Weirdeaux

Use this code to install:
`git checkout dapanda1/weirdhouse main`

This script is incredibly rough and hacked together from other scripts I have. It also doesn't buy, eat/drink, equip, or set your gear. Those need to be done here:

To run the script just enter `weirdhouse X` where X is the number of adventures you want to spend. If you have already ran this script and are on a new ascension you need to enter this command before running the script:

`ash set_property("currentweirdkill", 0);`

This resets the value to track the HP of the Weirdeaux monster.

IF the script breaks (you run out of MP or run out of items) you will need to run the first command again, when you defeat the monster (if the monster defeats you nothing is needed). If you just run away you don't need to run the command below. Running away is recommended.

`ash set_property("currentweirdkill", X);`

Where X is the number given in the line "Weirdeaux Monster's killed: XXXX" plus 1.

Recommendations on Familiar:

--Potato base familiar. Recommendation is Xiblaxian Holo-Companion: https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Xiblaxian_Holo-Companion

------_Xiblaxian holo-buddy simcode is really cheap in the mall and gives blocking and init_

--Use one of each of the soups from the primordial soup kitchen: https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/The_Primordial_Soup_Kitchen

---They give weight and extra abilities to the familiar. You want to hit a minimum weight of 60

---
Recommendations on Gear: (Everything in this section should be able to be gotten without buy an Iotm)

Hat:		Anything for maxing DA (I used Lens of Hatred	for lowering enemy defense.)

Back:		Anything	-- Just used this for buffing stats

Shirt:		Crimbuccaneer bombjacket -- This is for dealing more damage with combat items

Weapon:		Dinsey's pizza cutter -- HAVE TO HAVE (This has a skill that reduces the life of the monster to manageable levels)

Off-Hand:		ancient hot dog wrapper	-- Used for MP regen

Pants:		Greaves of the Murk Lord -- For Fam weight

Accessory 1:		Anything for buffing stats, restore MP or a blocking item

Accessory 2:		attorney's badge (from mall) OR Drunkula's ring of haze	(from Dread) -- blocks the next attack after you have been hit.

Accessory 3:		Mesmereyes™ contact lenses -- HAVE TO HAVE (This blocks attacks)

---
Things to note:

-Be wearing your outfit on before running the script

-Hat should be anything that helps max your DA and anything you want to wear is fine, I would suggest something with MP regen though.

-Mayo Clinic is really good for buffing stats if you have it.

-Crimbuccaneer bombjacket can be replaced with Jurassic Parka as it has an automatic stagger, but that is an IoTM.

HARD REQUIREMENTS:

-Skills: Funkslinging, Utensil Twist, Shadow Noodles, Curse of Marinara

-Combat Items (Lots of): Divine Blowout (Probably 10000-20000), CSA obedience grenade (Probably 2000-3000), gas balloon (Probably 2000-3000)

-Equipment: Dinsey's pizza cutter, Mesmereyes™ contact lenses
